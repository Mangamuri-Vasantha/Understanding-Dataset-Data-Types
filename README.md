# Task 1: Understanding Dataset & Data Types

## Project Overview
This project is part of the AI & ML Internship Task-1. The objective is to understand the structure, data types, and machine learning readiness of datasets before applying any modeling techniques.

Two datasets were analyzed:
- Student Performance Dataset
- Titanic Dataset

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Datasets
- **Student Performance Dataset**: Contains student demographic and academic information.  
  - Target Variable: `address`
- **Titanic Dataset**: Contains passenger details and survival status.  
  - Target Variable: `Age`

---

## Work Performed
- Loaded datasets using Pandas
- Displayed first and last records to understand structure
- Identified numerical and categorical features
- Checked data types and missing values using `info()` and `isnull()`
- Generated statistical summaries using `describe()`
- Identified target variables and input features
- Analyzed dataset size and suitability for machine learning
- Documented observations on data quality and imbalance

---

## Outcome
This task helped in understanding dataset characteristics, feature types, and data quality issues, ensuring proper preparation before applying machine learning models.
